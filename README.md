# Slot Machine
Python Slot Machine Code

## Abstract

The purpose of this project was to develop a slot machine program that allows the user to interact with program by placing bets. The program will allow the user to decide the amount of money deposited, and how much money they would like to bet per line. After the user inputs the necessary information, the program will generate and display a random instance of a slot machine.

## Libraries

[random]

## Future Alterations

- Current program requires user to bet in whole dollar amounts. Future update to allow users to bet with cents.

- Program has global constants(constraints) that prevent user from betting more than max amount for max lines. Future implementaton of slot machine tiers i.e. "high roller" slot machine, to allow user to choose their bet limits.
